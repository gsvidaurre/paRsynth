<h2>Setting up your work space in R</h2>

Before you start using the paRsynth package, you need to setup and install R, R studio, and GitHub Desktop on your computer.

<u>Install R and RStudio:</u>

* To install R on your computer, go to the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/) and download the latest version of R for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.
* To install RStudio on your computer, go to the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R a better and more user-friendly experience.

You will need to install GitHub Desktop to have the paRsynth GitHub repository on your local machine.

<u>GitHub Setup:</u>

* To install GitHub Desktop on your computer, go to the [GitHub Desktop website](https://github.com/apps/desktop) and click "Download now"
* After downloaded, open GitHub Destop and navigate to the top left toolbar, click on File > Clone Repository
* Open the [paRsynth GitHub repository](https://github.com/gsvidaurre/paRsynth) on your internet browser
* Click on the arrow of the green "Code" button
* Click on the copy link icon
* Paste the URL from the paRsynth GitHub repository
* Make sure the "Local Path" is where you want the paRsynth repository to be located on your local machine
* Click on the blue "Clone" button 
* Check to see that the paRsynth package is located in the appropriate local path of your machine that you assigned it

<h2>Purpose of the package</h2>

paRsynth provides four functions for the simulation of vocalizations with representation of both individual identity and group membership information. These vocalizations are encoded as strings that can be used for generating synthetic audio signals for bioacoustic analysis. This vignette will demonstrate how to use the package's functions to generate vocalizations strings, convert them into Parsons code, calculate frequency anchors, and generate synthetic audio files.

1. generate_strings(): generates strings that encode group membership information and individual identity information.
2. parsons_code(): converts the generated strings (characters) into Parsons code (musical up-down-constant connotation) for frequency modulation.
3. frequency_anchors(): calculates frequency anchors (numeric values that correspond to each segment of the Parsons code string) from Parsons code to guide the creation of synthetic audio.
4. write_audio(): uses frequency anchors and the 'soundgen' package to generate and save synthetic audio files.
