Use Parsons code to create frequency modulation calls with different amounts of individual identity and group membership information. These functions were developed for the sonification of character strings that represent vocal signals in agent-based models. The resulting audio files (created using the soundgen package) can be used in bioacoustics analyses downstream of the agent-based models.

The original code for these functions was developed by Ari Cross in collaboration with Dr. Vanessa Ferdinand and Dr. Grace Smith-Vidaurre. This package was primarily designed for in-house use by the Smith-Vidaurre and Ferdinand labs, but will be made publicly available for others to use and modify as they see fit.
